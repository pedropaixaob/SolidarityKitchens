This folder contains the files for Hub instances.
The location of the hubs were obtained via Cadastro Nacional de Endereços para Fins Estatísticos (CNEFE-IBGE), considering only religious facilities (churches, umbanda/candomblé centers, etc.).
Capacities were generated randomly using a stratification process in which 20% of the facilities are classified as "large", 30% as "medium" and 50% as "small". Besides, in each instance, two capacities are defined with artificially high capacities (1.000.000), referring to food banks with unlimited capacity.
