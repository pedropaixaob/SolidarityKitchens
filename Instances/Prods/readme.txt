This folder contains the files for Producer instances.
The location of the producers were obtained via Cadastro Nacional de Endereços para Fins Estatísticos (CNEFE-IBGE), considering only agricultural establishments (farms, cooperatives, etc.).
The producers' capacities were randomly generated from a uniform distribution, ensuring that the total capacity of the set of producers varied between 200,000 and 500,000 units. The capacities are different between each producer, respecting the heterogeneity of the establishments.
